  Problem Statement 4: Avanish’s Prank
  Overview:
  Dhruv being the social sparrow of his batch, loves to post his pictures and videos on socialmedia. But these days, He has become very conservative in terms of getting    reactions on hisposts. Last week Avanish started spamming his comment section as a fun game!! Dhruv is veryannoyed with it!!He wanted to block avanish, but being his   friend, it would be rude to block him, and that maybreak their friendship.The current social media which Dhruv is using, does not restrict the number of comments         posteby a particular user in a particular post. But Dhruv wants to restrict the number of comments bya particular user in a particular post.So he asked his friend Sparsh to help him make a social media with this feature along with wherehe can post pictures and write content. Number of actions by a particular user on a post must be limited.But Sparsh is having a house party this weekend, so he is busy arranging champagne andbeverages for the party. Also he has to clean his house as yesterday Zaid and Naitik crashed at his place and there is all messy around the house.So he asked you to help him, in return Sparsh will be inviting you to his house party. So move itfast. Hope You don’t wanna miss champagne.
